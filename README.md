# Reverse Scanner

A program that scans physical files with tables, pushes the data to a Postgres DB, and generates an excel file with the data.

# Motivation

At the time of this writing, I had a girlfriend that worked as the focal of a reverse logistics operation.

Sometimes she would spend many hours at home doing some tasks, such as manually inserting data from physical files with tables into excel files. 

This situation originated the idea of developing a program that automates such tasks so that she could spend more time with her children and me.
